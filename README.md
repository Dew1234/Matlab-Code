# Matlab-Code
Cornell Research Summer 2015 - Schaffer Lab

   This was used during a research project at Cornell University within the Schaffer Bio-Imaging Lab during the Summer of 2015. The original
project was to develop simulations of neural blood vessel networks to track the changes in blood flow that occur when blood clots form
as a result of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's.
   The code was developed using the MATLAB programming interface, and it creates a 2-dimensional virtual infrastructure for the simulations.
